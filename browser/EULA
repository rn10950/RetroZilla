                         System Requirements

==========================================================================

*Windows

   - Windows 95, 98, Me, NT4, 2000 or XP
   - Intel Pentium class processor (233 MHz or faster recommended)
   - 64 MB RAM
   - 26 MB free hard disk space

* We recommend that Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8.x and 10 users not use 
  RetroZilla, and instead use the current version of SeaMonkey or Firefox. 
  They are much more secure and compatible with the modern web than 
  RetroZilla is.

* We recommend that Windows 2000 users use Firefox 12 or SeaMonkey 2.9.

* We recommend that Windows 98 and Me users use Firefox 3.6 or SeaMonkey 
  2.0.14 with the KernelEx platform.

                      Installation Instructions

==========================================================================

It is strongly recommended that you exit all programs before running the
setup program. Also, you should temporarily disable virus-detection
software.

Install into a clean (new) directory. Installing on top of previously
released builds may cause problems.

Note: These instructions do not tell you how to build RetroZilla.

		<h2>RetroZilla 2.1</h2>
		<h3>New Features</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Updated default tab and security preferences</li>
			<li>Disabled sidebar opening by default when searching from address bar </li>
			<li>Added StartPage search engine</li>
			<li>&quot;? &lt;query&gt;&quot; from the urlbar initiates a Google Search</li>

		</ul>
		<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Copyright date on about:home updates dynamically.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Release Notes</h3>
		<p>
			Due to the long gap between the time RetroZilla was last worked on and now,
			We decided to release one last minor update before the work on Gecko begins.
			The new address bar search keywords may not work unless you have a new profile 
			created after the release of RetroZilla 2.1. We also added an update notifier 
			on the RetroZilla home page (about:home) to notify users that don't follow the 
			MSFN threads that a new version is out.

		<h2>RetroZilla 2.0</h2>
		<h3>New Features</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>New Home Page: about:home.</li>
			<li>about:changelog.</li>
			<li>Session Manager and Crash Restore system</li>
			<li>Updated internal URLs to reflect new website</li>

		</ul>
		<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>More &quot;M&quot; logos replaced.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Release Notes</h3>
		<p>
			This should be our last major features-only and rebrand release. Starting with 3.0, we will upgrade
			the Gecko core to be more compliant for the modern web. We would like to thank the developers of the
			Crash Recovery and Session Manager extensions for a platform to build on for our new Session Restore
			feature. Users who already have any these extensions installed are advised to remove them.

		</ul>
		<h3>Release Notes</h3>
